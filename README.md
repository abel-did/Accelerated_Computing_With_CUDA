# Accelerated Computing With CUDA - I

Utilize CUDA to enhance the performance of CPU-only applications by harnessing the power of GPUs. These CUDA-powered applications operate in parallel and deliver significantly faster results compared to their CPU-only counterparts. Dive into accelerating C/C++ applications by:

- Parallelizing applications for GPU execution.
- Employing CUDA techniques such as memory management for optimization.
- Exploring concepts like concurrency and CUDA streams.
- Leveraging tools like Nsight Systems for profiling and pinpointing bottlenecks.
